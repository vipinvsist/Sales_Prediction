# Big Mart Sales Prediction

### Project Overview:
The main objective is to build a predictive model that can  predict sales for Big Mart stores. To achieve this, we will use historical sales data, which contains information about past sales and other relevant attributes. By applying advanced data analysis and modeling techniques,we aim to identify patterns and trends in the data.

Through thorough analysis, we will develop a strong and reliable model that can forecast future sales trends. This model will be capable of providing valuable insights into how sales might behave in the future, allowing Big Mart to make informed decisions regarding inventory management and sales strategies.


### Dataset Description:
BigMart has compiled an extensive sales dataset spanning from the year 2013, encompassing information on a various distinct products across 4 stores types which are further divided in 3 tires located in various cities. The dataset comprises 12 attributes, including Item Fat, Item Type, Item MRP, Outlet Type, Item Visibility, Item Weight, Outlet Identifier, Outlet Size, Outlet Establishment Year, Outlet Location Type, Item Identifier, and Item Outlet Sales. Among these attributes, the Item Outlet Sales serves as the response variable, while the remaining attributes act as predictor variables.

### Data Description:

The dataset in question contains a total of 8523 rows, each representing a unique observation, and consists of 12 features. These features encapsulate diverse aspects of the data, providing valuable information for analysis and modeling. By leveraging this rich dataset, we aim to gain profound insights into the sales trends and patterns that unfold within the BigMart stores.
 
 #### Features Details:

Item Identifier: A unique ID assigned to each product.

Item Weight: The weight of the product.

Item Fat Content: Indicates whether the product is labeled as low fat or not.

Item Visibility: The percentage of total display area allocated to the specific product in a store.

Item Type: The category or type to which the product belongs.

Item MRP: The Maximum Retail Price (list price) of the product.

Outlet Identifier: A unique ID assigned to each store.

Outlet Establishment Year: The year in which the store was established.

Outlet Size: Indicates the size of the store in terms of ground area covered.

Outlet Location Type: Represents the type of city in which the store is located.

Outlet Type: Specifies whether the outlet is a grocery store or a supermarket.

Item Outlet Sales: The sales of the product in a particular store, which is the target variable to be predicted
